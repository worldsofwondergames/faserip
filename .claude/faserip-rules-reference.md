3. **Determine result color**: White (failure), Green (partial), Yellow (success), Red (critical)
4. **Apply outcome** based on result color

- **-1 Column Shift**: Move one rank lower (e.g., Good → Typical)
- **+2 CS**: Move two ranks higher
- **Automatic Yellow**: Success guaranteed at Yellow level
